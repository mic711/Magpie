Activity 1

1. Can you identify keywords to which your chatbot responds?

I picked the bot Chomsky: http://demo.vhost.pandorabots.com/pandora/talk?botid=b0dafd24ee35a477

One of the keywords seems to be "no, I mean".  It responds with things like "So that's what you mean"
or "Ah, I see what you mean".  

Another keyword is "asdf", to which the bot responds "Asdf are the first four letters you learn in typing".


2. Think of several keywords and the responses they might cause.

You could respond to the keyword "age" or "how old" with information about when the bot was created.
You could respond to questions about where you are with information about where the server is or
the location of the person who created the bot.  

Activity 2

1. What happens when a keyword is included in another word? Consider statements like “I know
all the state capitals” and “I like vegetables smothered in cheese.” Explain the problem with the
responses to these statements.

The program responds the same way to the keyword even if it is part of another word.  For
"I know all the state capitals", it sees the "no" part of "know" and responds "Why so negative".
For "I like vegetables smothered in cheese." it sees the "mother" part of "smothered", so it
asks about your family.  It doesn't know that when those substrings are found within another
word, the meaning changes.
